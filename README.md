# website-framework
This repository is used to maintain a record of web-pages we have created over the days and also to store them. 

I specifically had the idea of using these webpages as a template for future events such as Hackathons, Expos and other projects where making a new frontend site takes unnecessary time when these work be done in advance. 

All ideas are welcome and make your own branch with your name. Please don't upload in the 'main' branch. 

Thank you and happy coding!
